<p>One of the most important aspects of context in mobile computing is mobility itself. It is variable, complex, and is highly pertinent to mobile computing. Kristoffersen and Ljungberg [25] define three types of mobility: traveling, visiting, and wandering. All three types frequently occur in novel environments. Wandering and traveling are similar, yet differentiated primarily by scale; wandering is conceived of as movement within a place whereas traveling is defined as movement between places. Visiting is the act of being in one place for a limited amount of time and then moving on to another place. With these three types of mobility only visiting implies a truly static position for any reasonable length of time. Traveling and wandering are predominantly spatially dynamic states, requiring applications that afford using while moving. Mobile computing can occur in any of these states of mobility, therefore it is essential to consider how interactions are performed in the traveling and wandering states, in particular, as they are the most challenging for mobile device designers. Currently, mobile computing devices and applications seem to be predominantly designed around use in visiting scenarios. A recent investigation cited movement as the most important contextual factor relevant to the user [26].</p>
