<br>Motivation
<p> 
Mobile computing is an empowering notion to many people. The value that can be added by enabling access to powerful electronic devices in a portable form has yet to be fully realized, but obviously has vast potential in terms of productivity and communication for business, personal, educational, and medical purposes, just to scratch the surface. However, there is currently a large gap between the vision of mobile computing that has been created and the existing state of mobile computing, due in part to the relative youth of the field, but also to the inherent challenge of designing devices that are intended to be mobile.</p>
